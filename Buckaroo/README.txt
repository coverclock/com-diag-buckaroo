This is the Digital Aggregates Corporation Buckaroo package. Buckaroo is a
collection of Java classes that includes traffic shaping and rate limiting
throttles, Instant Managed Beans that allow you to trivially export system
status and management information via the JMX console, and some other useful
(and experimental) stuff.
